# petNow
#### Created by Khoa Thien Le (Harry), contributed by Danko Beribak, Melissa Lobuescher, Arman Balani.

#### ***Purpose***
Ruby on Rails app that proposes that platform for people who love pets but do not have much time to commit to raising a pet. Instead, interested users can browser for available-for-rent pets from other users. On the other hand, the owners of the pets can also benefit from this as they can make money while still having someone taking care of their pets if they are away for any reason.

#### ***Notes***
- App was seeded with fake data for the purpose of learning and demo. App is not in use.
- Website is really slow to load because we are using free tier of Heroku.
